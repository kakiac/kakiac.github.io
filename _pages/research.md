## Computational Modelling of Community Resilience

<img src="../assets/images/11.png" width="1000">


The elaborate coloration of many male animals has inspired biologists to study the function of elaborate male ornaments since Darwin and Wallace. That male ornaments face sexual and social selection pressures is now fundamental in evolutionary biology, but what function, if any, female ornaments serve is comparatively less known. My Ph.D. dissertation focused on a unique species of bird that varies between subspecies by female, but not male, coloration. This provides a system well suited for studying the function and physiology of female coloration. I experimentally test the function of female ornaments using controlled song and mount playback trials to free flying birds and compare the role of testosterone in mediating aggression and ornamentation between the sexes.

## Using Text Data mining to study Political Discourse

<img src="../assets/images/13.png" width="1000">

 <!-- to rewrite -->
Textual data represents rich information, but lacks structure and requires specialist techniques to be mined and linked properly as well as to reason with and make useful correlations. I have been using Python and R for extracting entities, relations between them, opinions and other elements to support semantic indexing and visualisation and anonymisation.

## Developing methods to evaluate, target and monitor preventative inteventions

<img src="../assets/images/12.png" width="1000">

Models and statistical methods for the analysis of local government health and social care data will be developed alongside new data mining and machine learning algorithms to identify intervention subgroups, and new joint modelling methods to improve existing predictive models with a view to evaluate, target and monitor the provision of care.





## Building Capacity in advanced data skills for charities, local authorities and businesses




<!-- I research legislative politics/legislative institutions with a focus on the European Union. My interests include political negotiations such as the infamous early agreement system in the European Union and its consequences for representation and political power. My work also relates to the determinants of bargaining failure, the consequences of increased politicization of EU politics, parliamentary behavior of Euroskeptic representatives to the European Parliament, and improving measurement methods for concepts such as policy influence and support for integration.-->

<!-- Methodologically, I focus on Bayesian statistics, machine learning, deep learning and I also apply methods for causal inference with observational data. Currently, I participate in a project on using machine learning techniques to better estimate subnational public opinion. Furthermore, I take part in an effort that applies quantitative text analysis to leverage data from open-ended survey questions collected by development organisations, in a project on forecasting conflict escalation from big data, and an analysis of peace agreement texts to identify common strategies of mediators, their success, and determinants of the negotiation agenda.-->

<!--As part of the mission of the ESRC Business and Local Government Data Research Centre, I instruct members of local government institutions such as law enforcement in R, Python, introductory and advanced statistics. Furthermore, I have experience teaching quantitative methods at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and I advice local government institutions, human rights/civil liberties NGOs and civil society charities on research methodology. -->
