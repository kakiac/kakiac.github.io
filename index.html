<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>I am a <emph>Senior Researcher</emph> at the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/business-and-local-government-data" target=blank>ESRC Business and Local Government Data Research Centre</a> at the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk" target=blank>University of Essex</a>. From May 2021, I will be a <b>Lecturer</b> at the <a href="http://www.uos.ac.uk" target=blank>University of Suffolk</a> in the School of Engineering, Arts, Science and Technology. </p>

<p>My research focuses on automated, quantitative methods of processing large amounts of textual and other forms of unstructured data – mainly political texts and social media – and the methodology of text mining. My research is driven by my fascination with all kinds of data (big/small, text/number/images) and how it can help us better understand ourselves and our society. I am also interested in how data can be used to improve resilience, maximise accountability and trust and reduce inequalities.</p>

<p>Projects I work on leverage current technologies in machine learning, natural language processing and experimental behavioral study to describe the mechanisms for digital transformation in communities, businesses and the public sector and how data can be used as an enabler of a fairer, more transparent and accountable society.</p>

## Research

My research focuses on automated, quantitative methods of processing large amounts of textual and other forms of unstructured data – mainly political texts and social media – and the methodology of text mining.

I have published on applications of measurement and the analysis of text as data on machine learning methods and deep learning. I am also applying machine learning and natural language processing techniques to the analysis of public policy. My substantive research interests centre on resilience and the role of public policies and institutions at different levels of governance in shaping it.

I have worked as an evaluation and digital tranformation scientiic advisor with local authorities and voluntary sector organisations in the UK and have delivered training to policy makers on evaluation practices, text analytics and data enabling transformation.

Recent evaluation work includes the evaluation of the Essex Data Platform programme (Essex County Council) and she is currently supporting Essex Dementia Challenge Prize contestants evaluate solutions aimed at improving the life of people with dementia (Essex County Council).

I am a member of the [Natural Language and Information Processing Research Group](http://essexnlip.uk/), the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/) and have represented the University at the [Wider Eastern Information Stakeholder Forum](https://weisf.essex.gov.uk/).

## Enabling Community Resilience through Digital Transformation

<img src="../assets/images/11.png" width="1000">


The elaborate coloration of many male animals has inspired biologists to study the function of elaborate male ornaments since Darwin and Wallace. That male ornaments face sexual and social selection pressures is now fundamental in evolutionary biology, but what function, if any, female ornaments serve is comparatively less known. My Ph.D. dissertation focused on a unique species of bird that varies between subspecies by female, but not male, coloration. This provides a system well suited for studying the function and physiology of female coloration. I experimentally test the function of female ornaments using controlled song and mount playback trials to free flying birds and compare the role of testosterone in mediating aggression and ornamentation between the sexes.

## Using Text Data mining to study Political Discourse

<!--
Textual data represents rich information, but lacks structure and requires specialist techniques to be mined and linked properly as well as to reason with and make useful correlations. I have been using Python and R for extracting entities, relations between them, opinions and other elements to support semantic indexing and visualisation and anonymisation.
